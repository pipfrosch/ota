  <h1 id="antenna.label">Antenna Selection</h1>
  <p>Selecting the right antenna(s) can be a difficult task. There are several things to take into consideration.</p>
  <section id="location" aria-labelledby="location.label">
    <h2 id="location.label">Install Location</h2>
    <p>Generally speaking there are three options for your home antenna install location:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Roof Install</li>
      <li>Attic Install</li>
      <li>Bedroom/Living Room install</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you are only interested in one television <em>and</em> you are relatively close to the broadcast towers you are interested in, an antenna installed in the same room as the television it is intended to service is often very practical.</p>
    <p>Be careful, a lot of indoor antennas are cheap junk. In some rooms of your home they will not work very well at all, and there often will be glitches in stream decoding when people walk around in or even near the room.</p>
    <p>Antennas installed on the roof typically will have the best reception, but the antenna has to be earthed (see the appendix chapter <a href="bond_earth_ground.xhtml">Bonding, Earthing, and Grounding</a>) which means it almost certainly needs to be installed on the same side of the house as your main electrical panel because that is where your ground rod is and no, you can not just install another ground rod elsewhere without major additional electrician work beyond just physically installing the ground rod. Antennas installed on the roof are also subject to the elements and may need to be re-adjusted after strong winds.</p>
    <p>If you have an attic and the broadcast stations you want are within 60 miles, attic installs can often work quite well and do not need to be earthed. However if you have radiant heat shielding in your attic, that will interfere with the signal. Air ducts in the attic with a shiny coating also can be problematic, so you will need to make sure to pick an antenna model that has an available reflector (sometimes sold separately) to reduce stray signals bouncing off of the ducts. If there are solar panels on your roof, the inverters in the attic may interfere with the signal reception as well so a attic install should be physically distant from the inverters. The previously mentioned reflector may help with that as well.</p>
    <p>Unless you have radiant heat shielding in the attic (which likely saves you a lot of money on <abbr title="Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning">HVAC</abbr> power consumption if you do) if you have an attic, that is where I generally recommend trying an antenna install. If you just can not get reception in the attic for the stations you want, most antennas designed to work in an attic can also be installed on your roof.</p>
    <p>The point is, you do need to decide where you want to install your antenna as that makes a difference in the model you choose.</p>
    <p>With the exception of Bedroom/Living Room antennas I would recommend against buying an antenna with a built-in preamplifier. Amplification&#8212;if needed&#8212;is best provided by a separate device.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="bands" aria-labelledby="bands.label">
    <h2 id="bands.label">Frequency Bands and Antennas</h2>
    <p>There are four different broadcast bands you may be interested in receiving through your antenna system:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>TV VHF-Lo</dt>
        <dd>54&#8211;88 MHz (<abbr>RF</abbr> Channels 2&#8211;6)</dd>
      <dt><abbr>FM</abbr> Radio</dt>
        <dd>88&#8211;108 MHz</dd>
      <dt>TV VHF-Hi</dt>
        <dd>174&#8211;216 MHz (<abbr>RF</abbr> Channels 7&#8211;13)</dd>
      <dt>TV UHF</dt>
        <dd>470&#8211;608 MHz (<abbr>RF</abbr> Channels 14&#8211;36)</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>There are basically three models of antenna that work:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Loop antenna</li>
      <li>Dipole antenna</li>
      <li>Folded Dipole antenna</li>
      <li>Monopole (whip) antenna</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you want very detailed presentation on how antennas work, I highly recommend the <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/antenna_theory/" title="Internet Resource">Antenna Theory Tutorial</a> at Tutorialspoint. Hopefully enough to just get by is presented here.</p>
    <p>Loop antenaas have the best gain but with a loop antenna, the circumfrence of the loop should equal the wavelength of the lowest frequency you wish to receive well. Wavelength decreases as frequency increases and can be calculated with the following formula where L is the wavelength, c is the speed of light (aproximately 3.8 x 10^8 m/s) and f is the frequency:</p>
    <span class="math">L=c/f</span>
    <p>The lowest frequency in the television broadcast UHF band is 608 MHz resulting in a circumfrence of roughly half a meter and if a perfect cicle is used, a diameter of 16 centimeters. That is a relatively small loop, many of the antennas on the market today have two of these loops, some even have four. This allows for excellent gain at the antenna of everything in the television broadcast UHF band even with the compact size used for indoor antennas that only use one loop. My cheap indoor antenna is a rectangle 9 inches by 8 inches which easily accomodates a loop of that size contained within.</p>
    <p>The highest frequency in the television broadcast VHF range (taking into account 6 MHz of bandwidth) is 102 MHz. That would require a loop of roughly 3 meters and if a perfect circle was used, a diameter of about 0.9 meters. Such a loop would be very large and use a lot of material and it would degrade for anything below RF channel 13, so dipole antennas are typically used for television broadcast UHF and broadcast <abbr>FM</abbr> radio at the cost of some gain.</p>
    <p>With a dipole, two different rods of the same length are used, with each rod being &#188; of the wave-length for a total of &#189; of the wavelength between them. On large outdoor VHF antennas installed on a roof you will see an array of dipoles.</p>
    <p>The dipole ideal length for the lowest frequency in VHF-Hi band would be about 43 centimeters (just under 18 inches) and for the VHF-Lo band it would be about 1.4 meters!</p>
    <p>The length of the rods needed can be shortened by using a loading coil but a cost of reduction in gain.</p>
    <p>Monopole antennas are generally only used on portable devices such as an <abbr>FM</abbr> radio or a vehicle.</p>

  <section id="uhf" aria-labelledby="uhf.label">
    <h2 id="uhf.label">Ultra High Frequency Television</h2>
    <p>The vast majority of <abbr>OTA</abbr> television broadcast takes place within the 470&#8211;608 MHz <abbr>UHF</abbr> band.</p>
    <p>The distinctive advantage that <abbr>UHF</abbr> has is that due to the higher frequency, the wavelength is shorter allowing for the antenna to be smaller. Also, <abbr>VHF</abbr> is more susceptible to noise and the power that <abbr>VHF</abbr> broadcasters are allowed to use is limited by the <abbr>FCC</abbr>.</p>
    <p>Your antenna almost certainly will need to adequately cover the <abbr>UHF</abbr> band and the vast majority on the market do but you still need to make sure.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="vhf" aria-labelledby="vhf.label">
    <h2 id="vhf.label">Very High Frequency Television</h2>
    <p>For historical allocation reasons, television broadcasts that use <abbr>VHF</abbr> are split into two distinct frequency ranges with a rather larger gap between them. RF channels 2&#8211;5 are what is called VHF-Lo and RF channels 6&#8211;13 are what is called VHF-Hi.</p>
    <p>The compact antennas that easily install inside an attic (or often even in a room) very rarely do well with VHF.</p>
    <p>When they offer VHF at all, VHF is usually added as an afterthought and if you look at the gain, VHF gain is <em>much</em> lower than UHF gain. For example, the ClearStream 2MAX® that we have installed in our attic here specifies 8.7 dBi gain for UHF but only 2.6 dBi for VHF. Combine that lower gain with the lower transmission power the <abbr>FCC</abbr> requires for VHF broadcast and you will likely see the problem.</p>
    <p>Attic/Indoor antennas that offer UFH + VHF usually only work well for VHF with VHF-Hi but with a shorter range than you would get with UHF. If any of them work at all with VHF-Lo you would have to be really close.</p>
    <p>If you have multiple VHF stations you really want to receive, a Yagi-Uda (sometimes just called a Yagi even though it was likely invented by Shintaro Uda) installed on your roof is probably your best bet.</p>
    <p>Yagi-Uda antennas are directional so if you need VHF stations from multiple directions, you may need turn it or you can install two of them (they can be installed on the same mast) and use a signal combiner.</p>
    <p>When VHF reception is not quite as critical but it still desired or when an outdoor antenna is not desired, the potential solutions vary upon the desired VHF stations.</p>
    <p>For VHF-Hi (RF channels 7&#8211;13) there is a decent chance a UHF+VFH antenna will in fact pull them in for you.</p>
    <p>If they do not, Antennas Direct sells one called the <a href="https://store.antennasdirect.com/C5-Clearstream-5-vhf-uhf-long-range-outdoor-DTV-antenna.html" title="Internet Resource">ClearStream® 5 VHF Attic/Outdoor HDTV Antenna</a>.</p>
    <p>That antenna has a list price of $160 but is often on sale. Looking at it, it is basically a loop antenna with a reflector. The technical data sheet seems to indicate it is good for VHF-Hi (RF channels 7&#8211;13) so it may not help very much if at all with VHF-Lo (RF channels 2&#8211;6)</p>
    <p>With the ClearStream® 5, if you also want UHF you will likely need to use a combiner to join the signal from this antenna with an antenna for UHF.</p>
    <p>For VHF-Lo where a Yagi-Uda antenna is not an option, you may need to build your own.</p>
    <p>I have an idea for a &#8216;3D Folded loop&#8217; antenna that should pick up VHF-Lo along with <abbr>FM</abbr> radio stations while still remaining small enough for a practical attic install. If my idea pans out I will add a section on how to build one but right now it is just an untested idea in my head. Demand for VHF-Lo from an attic antenna just seems to be too low for antenna manufacturers to address it.</p>

  <section id="radio" aria-labelledby="radio.label">
    <h2 id="radio.label">The Spirit of Radio</h2>
    <blockquote>Invisible airwaves crackle with life&#8212;Bright antennae bristle with the energy (Rush)</blockquote>
    <p>Many people are not very interested in the <abbr>FM</abbr> Radio band however it is worth mentioning because most component <abbr>AM</abbr>/<abbr>FM</abbr> receivers do have a 75Ω coaxial female F-connector antenna jack and can have improved reception from a television antenna that picks up that radio band.</p>
    <figure aria-labelledby="figure.stereo.label">
      <img src="images/stereo75.jpg" alt="Photo of ports on back of stereo receiver"/>
      <figcaption id="figure.stereo.label">The back of my Yamaha R-S201 receiver showing a 75Ω coaxial female F-connector antenna jack</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>While analog <abbr>FM</abbr> broadcasts will likely be around for a very long time, some stations also now broadcast digital with a digital FM receiver you will often get additional substations on the same frequency that are not available on an analog receiver.</p>
    <p>If you or someone in your home likes listening to the radio then receiving <abbr>FM</abbr> broadcasts through your antenna may be a legitimate consideration.</p>
    <p>With a quality VHF antenna like the Yagi-Uda that receives both VHF-Lo and VHF-Hi, <abbr>FM</abbr> reception is likely to be very good from it. Just plug a 75Ω coax line from your antenna in and see if reception of the stations you want improves.</p>
    <p>Another option is to buy an antenna specifically for <abbr>FM</abbr> reception and use a signal combiner to add it to the signal used for UHF/VHF-Hi.</p>
    <p>Of course if there are only a few radios in the house that need <abbr>FM</abbr> reception you could just run seperate coax specifically for the <abbr>FM</abbr> receivers.</p>
    <p>Note that some preamplifiers intentionally block the broadcast <abbr>FM</abbr> band to prevent overload from a close radio station that <em>when amplified</em> could interfere with television reception. If you do combine an <abbr>FM</abbr> antenna with another antenna and you use a preamplifier, either make sure the preamplifier does not block that frequency range or combine the signals after the preamplifier.</p>
    <p><abbr>AM</abbr> radio operates from 550&#8211;1720 kHz (within the Medium Frequency band) and would not benefit from a television antenna like <abbr>FM</abbr> radio does.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="clusters" aria-labelledby="clusters.label">
    <h2 id="clusters.label">Distance and Direction</h2>
    <p>Part of determining the proper antenna that meets your needs is determining which broadcast antennas are important to your reception.</p>
    <p>For example, there is a good chance you want an ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox affiliate in order to have local news available as Internet streaming packages that include them are often expensive if available at all. Some special interest broadcasters, such as broadcasts in a non-English language, may not be available through a streaming service at all. Some broadcasts, such as Ion and Comet, are often readily available through inexpensive Internet streaming services.</p>
    <p>Antennas Direct has an excellent &#8216;<a href="https://www.antennasdirect.com/transmitter-locator.html" title="Internet Resource">TV Transmitter Locator and Mapping Tool</a>&#8217; to help you determine what broadcasters are <em>potentially</em> in your range. Other websites also offer similar tools, but I found that as of <time datetime="2020-10-02">2 October 2020</time> their tool had the most accurate database for broadcasters in my area. Some of the other websites had outdated information.</p>
    <p>This is what the map looked like for me:</p>
    <figure id="transmap" aria-labelledby="figure.transmap.label">
      <img src="images/transmap.jpg"/>
      <figcaption id="figure.transmap.label">Generated map showing broadcast transmitter locations centered around the city of Brentwood in the San Francisco Bay Area.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In addition to the broadcast transmitter map, the tool provides a table of all potential stations within a 60 mile radius including the Call Sign, Affiliate (when applicable), Virtual Channel, DTV Channel (also known as RF Channel), Band (UHF or VHF), heading in degrees East of North, and the approximate distance. The table is ordered by distance with closest listed first.</p>
    <p>Not all of the black dots necessarily correspond with broadcast television stations. For example, in my results within the inner-most circle (35 mile range circle) there is a transmitter dot between my location and San Francisco. That dot does correspond with a transmitter but that transmitter does not transmit broadcast television, it seems to primarily&#8212;if not exclusively&#8212;act as a FM radio repeater for FM radio stations in San Francisco.</p>
    <p>Speaking of Mount Diablo, it lies between me and the two transmitter clusters in San Francisco, making it highly unlikely that I would be able to receive any of those stations reliably if at all.</p>
    <p>The goal is to figure out which cluster you want to point your antenna towards, and whether or not you may end up needing a second antenna pointed in a different direction to meet your needs.</p>
    <p>When there are multiple clusters within a 60 mile radius but in many different directions, it is highly unlikely you will be able to get all of the clusters due to geography between you and the clusters. Try to determine which clusters are a reasonable expectation.</p>
    <p>Well within the 35 mile radius roughly 27° East of North is a cluster with many transmitters. It includes all of the major live TV affiliates (ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS, Fox) as well as ION, Comet TV, and UniMás. That is the transmitter cluster I am focusing on, I guess I am quite lucky to have so much available so close. That is my primary target cluster.</p>
    <p>Almost directly north of my primary target cluster within the 50 mile radius circle is a Crssing station which provides multilingual Asian content. The same antenna that picks up my primary target cluster could probably pick up that station if its range was long enough, so if I wanted to pick up that station I would want to make sure my antenna was capable of 50&#8211;60 miles. The transmitter in that general direction that is within the 60 mile radius does not appear to transmit television at this time.</p>
    <p>Moving counter-clockwise, there are two transmitters between Santa Rosa and San Francisco. There is a good chance geography would be a problem even with an antenna that can handle 60 miles. One of those transmitters does not appear to transmit television and the other transmits a PBS station which is of interest, but it transmits on the VHF-Lo RF channel 5. With that distance it would probably require a Yagi-Uda antenna mounted on the roof pointed in that direction and that would only work if geography did not get in the way. Especially since there is already a PBS affiliate in my target cluster, putting out that kind of expense to <em>maybe</em> get a single station just is not worth it.</p>
    <p>The odds of getting the San Francisco clusters within the 50 mile radius circle are almost certainly not possible due to Mount Diablo and its foothills. The PBS affiliate there would be nice, and the Fox affiliate there would be nice because <em>occassionally</em> it carries football games not carried by the Fox affiliate within my target cluster, but I just do not think those stations are reachable.</p>
    <p>The cluster just inside the 35 mile radius that is just north of San Jose is a possibility, but the only network affiliate in that cluster of high value to me is an NBC affiliate but there is already an NBC affiliate that is closer. The transmitter also just in the 35 mile radius but to the right of that cluster broadcasts Assyrian programming. If Assyrian programming was important to me, I may potentially want a second antenna pointed in that direction.</p>
    <p>To the east of me and just north a tag, within the 60 mile radius on the other side of Stockton from me is a Univision station. For those who speak Spanish in my local area, pointing a second antenna in that direction may be <em>highly</em> desirable. Yes there already is UniMás that is different than Univision.</p>
    <p>So in my case, my primary antenna will be pointed roughly 30° East of North and needs to have a 35 mile range.</p>
    <p>If I was interested in multilingual Asian content, I would want to make sure the antenna could handle a 50&#8211;60 mile range.</p>
    <p>If I was interested in Assyrian programming, I would want a second antenna to pick up that station (or an antenna with rotating base) that has at least a 40&#8211;50 mile range.</p>
    <p>If I was interested in additional Spanish programming, I would want a second antenna to pick up that station (or an antenna with rotating base) that has at least a 60 mile range.</p>
    <p>As one of the stations in my target cluster (the PBS affiliate) does broadcast on VHF-Hi RF channel 9, the antenna should have VHF-Hi capabilities. In my case with a desired attic install, the <a href="https://store.antennasdirect.com/ClearStream-2MAX-Indoor-Outdoor-TV-Antenna.html" title="Internet Resource">ClearStream 2MAX® UHF/VHF</a> is likely the best choice. That antenna clames a 60 mile range but in an attic install opposed to a rood install, that range is likely reduced to 45 miles. If a longer range was needed, such as a second antenna for the Univision station I could potentially pick up, the <a href="https://store.antennasdirect.com/ClearStream-4MAX-Outdoor-TV-Antenna.html" title="Internet Resource">ClearStream 4MAX® UHF/VHF</a> would be a better fit.</p>
    <p>The live broadcast stations we get with XFinity that we will miss are the Fox affiliate KTVU and the PBS affiliate KQED as their transmitters are blocked from us by Mount Diablo. However we will get a Fox affiliate that carries all the 49er games and <em>usually</em> carries the non-49er games carried by KTVU and we will get a PBS that carries much of the content KQED carries.</p>

  <section id="combiner" aria-labelledby="combiner.label">
    <h2 id="combiner.label">Signal Combiner</h2>
    <p>In cases where one antenna does not meet your priorities but two can, you can combine the signals from multiple antennas into a single feed. This does however come with a decibel loss.</p>
    <p>In theory, an inexpensive <em>passive</em> coax splitter can be also be used as a combiner although I have heard reports some models do not work well. I suspect user error. Amplified distributors can not be used as a combiner.</p>
    <p>The &#8216;out&#8217; ports are where you connect the feed from the signals you want to combine. The &#8216;in&#8217; port then becomes the output that carries the combined signal.</p>
    <p>Usually you will only need to combine a signal from two different antennas. In that case, a passive two-way splitter does the job at a cost of about 4dB of signal strength.</p>
    <p>To combine 3 signals, use a three-way passive splitter and put the antenna with the weakest signal on the 3.5/4 dB output with the other two on the 7/8 dB output. The input then becomes the output with the combined signal. The weakest signal will have a cost of 4 dB signal loss and the other two will have a cost of 8 dB signal loss.</p>
    <p>In the unlikely but possible scenario where you want to join four signals, use a four way passive splitter could be used and each signal would suffer an 8 dB strength loss.</p>
    <p>With some exceptions, you want to combine the signals <em>before</em> the preamplifier if you use one.</p>
    <p>One scenario where you do not want to join them before the pre-amplifier is if one antenna is pointed at a broadcast cluster very close to you and does not need amplification and another is pointed at a distant broadcast cluster that does need amplification. In that scenario, only the antenna pointing to the distant cluster should be amplified or you risk overload from the broadcast cluster that is close to you.</p>
    <p>Another possible scenerio where you do not want to join them before the preamplifier is sometimes with broadcast <abbr>FM</abbr> radio.</p>
    <p>Many cities that do not have local television broadcast transmitters do have local <abbr>FM</abbr> broadcast transmitters. In that case, amplifying the broadcast <abbr>FM</abbr> signal can cause signal overload that prevents television from signals from working. In that scenario, you want to combine the signal from the broadcast <abbr>FM</abbr> antenna after preamplification of the antennas for television.</p>
    <p>If you have two antennas <em>pointed in the same direction</em> and there is overlap in the frequencies they receive, the signal for those frequencies can be damaged by the reception from the two antennas being out of phase. In that scenario, you can use a low-pass or high-pass filter on one or both antenna <em>before</em> joining their signal.</p>
    <p>For example, if using one antenna for VHF and another for UHF, you may want a low-pass filter on the feed from the VHF antenna to filter out every frequency above the VHF band and a high-pass filter on the UHF feed to filter out every frequency below the UHF band. Then it will be safe to combine them. There are some combiners sold specifically for that purpose that have those filters built-in.</p>

    <h2 id="vendors.label">Antenna Vendors</h2>
    <p>For a bedroom/living room antenna&#8212;what is often called an &#8216;indoor antenna&#8217;&#8212;you have to be careful because there is a lot of cheap junk on the market. When they work the picture is just as beautiful as the expensive antennas, but their range is quite limited and they often have trouble decoding the digital signal if someone happens to be standing in the wrong place.</p>
    <p>I would likely recommend the &#8216;ClearStream ECLIPSE® Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna&#8217; from <a href="https://store.antennasdirect.com/indoor-tv-antennas.html" title="Internet Resource">Antennas Direct</a>. It does not receive any VHF channels.</p>
    <p>For attic antennas, I also would recommend <a href="https://store.antennasdirect.com/attic-tv-antennas.html" title="Internet Resource">Antennas Direct</a> but the particular model depends upon your needs. Most of those will also work installed on the roof.</p>
    <p>For an outdoor Yagi-Uda antenna, I would recommend looking at what <a href="https://www.channelmaster.com/Outdoor_Antennas_s/20.htm" title="Internet Resource">Channel Master</a> has to offer.</p>
    <p>For a fun science project with the kids, good designs for building your own antenna can be found on the web.</p>
