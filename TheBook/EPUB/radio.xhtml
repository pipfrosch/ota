  <p>Television is not the only source of news and entertainment that uses radio transmissions that are free to receive. <abbr>AM</abbr> and <abbr>FM</abbr> radio predate television considerably and are both still very much alive.</p>

    <p>This chapter heavily references parts from a company called Pixel Technologies. No money or discounts were received from Pixel Technologies, my only interactions with that company was as a full paying customer. Their parts are heavily referenced here because they make and sell quality parts needed to work with the broadcast <abbr>AM</abbr> band, I was not able to find any other companies that cared much about the <abbr>AM</abbr> band even though <abbr>AM</abbr> radio can often can be an extremely valuable resource for information and should not be ignored.</p>
  </aside>

  <p>Please note that if you are <em>only</em> interested in <abbr>FM</abbr> radio, things are somewhat simpler. The <abbr>FM</abbr> band falls between <abbr>VHF-Lo</abbr> and <abbr>VHF-Hi</abbr> and most modern radio tuners (in the United States) with antenna input use the same 75Ω coaxial female F-connector antenna jack that ATSC television uses.</p>

    <figcaption id="figure.stereo.label">The back of my Yamaha R-S201 receiver showing a 75Ω coaxial female F-connector antenna jack for <abbr>FM</abbr> and a two push-wire connectors for <abbr>AM</abbr>.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>These 75Ω impedence antenna jacks and the location of the <abbr>FM</abbr> band within the <abbr>OTA</abbr> television bands allow for the same splitters and signal amplifiers that work with <abbr>OTA</abbr> television to also work well with <abbr>FM</abbr> broadcast.</p>
  <p>In fact for broadcast <abbr>FM</abbr> radio, if your television antenna works with both <abbr>VHF-Lo</abbr> and <abbr>VHF-Hi</abbr> there is a good possibility it also works well for broadcast <abbr>FM</abbr> (at least for broadcasts from the same direction for which the antenna is pointed&#8230;)</p>
  <p>To distribute only <abbr>FM</abbr> broadcast to multiple destinations in your home you could just use a signal combiner to combine the output of an <abbr>FM</abbr> antenna with your television antenna. However in practice that is usually not the right solution. <abbr>ATSC</abbr> tuners do not decode <abbr>FM</abbr> signals (analog or digital) so thus you would lose about 4 dB of signal strength from each antenna when combining the signals only to then lose another 4 dB when the coaxial line is then split to feed both an <abbr>ATSC</abbr> tuner and an <abbr>FM</abbr> tuner in a room that wants both. That is a 7&#8211;8 dB loss for both television and <abbr>FM</abbr> radio can be avoided by running separate coaxial cables for television and <abbr>FM</abbr> radio.</p>
  <p>If you also want <abbr>AM</abbr> radio, <abbr>AM</abbr> broadcasts in the 550&#8211;1720 kHz (0.55&#8211;1.72 MHz) band which unfortunately is well below the operational range for the amplifiers and splitters that are commonly used for <abbr>OTA</abbr> television.</p>
  <p>This chapter discusses setting up an <abbr>AM</abbr>/<abbr>FM</abbr> antenna for a signal distributed to multiple receivers through a coaxial cable <em>independent of the television coaxial cables</em>.</p>
  <p>Notes are also provided for those setting up a similar coaxial system that is either <abbr>FM</abbr> only or one that also supports distribution of a SiriusXM satelite radio signal.</p>
  
  <section id="antenna" aria-labelledby="antenna.label">
    <h2 id="antenna.label">Antenna Selection</h2>
    <p>If you are only interested in distributing <abbr>FM</abbr> through a coaxial system to multiple receivers, there are many choices including models that often do well in an attic, though installation on a roof top is generally better.</p>
    <p>If you are trying to receive a particular distant <abbr>FM</abbr> station, a directional antenna installed on your roof is the best bet. Generally however an <abbr>FM</abbr> antenna distributed to several receivers should <em>probably</em> be omni-directional.</p>
    <p>Some models&#8212;such as the horizontal folded loop antennas that often work well in an attic&#8212;are only <em>mostly</em> omni-directional and you might have to play with the direction to find the best reception position for the stations you want. They are omni-directional enough that you usually can leave them in that position once you have found the sweet spot.</p>
    <p>A large folded dipole antenna also often works well for <abbr>FM</abbr> in the attic though you would need a 300Ω to 75Ω balun adapter to distribute the signal through coaxial cable.</p>
    <p>Monopole &#8216;whip&#8217; antennas mounted vertically are truly omni-directional but are less likely to do as well inside an attic due to their height, though sometimes they do just fine.</p>
    <p>For distributing <abbr>AM</abbr> broadcasts in addition to <abbr>FM</abbr> broadcasts, the only commercial antenna I found that works well distributed to multiple outputs through a coaxial cable system is the Pixel Technologies <a href="https://pixelsatradio.com/collections/antennas/products/afhd-4-long-range-am-fm-hd-radio-antenna" title="Internet Resource">AFHD-4 Antenna kit</a>. It is a monopole &#8216;whip&#8217; antenna with a 48 inch rod. It could be installed in some attics but the height of the rod limits the locations within an attic which may make it difficult to install the antenna away from sources of radio interference, such as the <abbr>HVAC</abbr> system or solar related equipment. <abbr>AM</abbr> broadcast reception is particularly impacted by interference noise.</p>
    <p>Note that the AFHD-4 kit is just for <abbr>AM</abbr>/<abbr>FM</abbr> reception. If you want SiriusXM as well as <abbr>AM</abbr>/<abbr>FM</abbr>, then you should get the <a href="https://pixelsatradio.com/collections/antennas/products/afxsm-5-am-fm-hd-siriusxm-radio-multi-signal-antenna-kit" title="Internet Resource">AFXSM-5 Antenna Kit</a> or the <a href="https://pixelsatradio.com/collections/antennas/products/pixel-technologies-multi-band-outdoor-antenna-pro600-kit" title="Internet Resource">AFXSM-6 Antenna Kit</a> instead.</p>
    <p>The AFHD-4 kit is what I used for the tests at the end of this chapter. I did not use the AFXSM-[5,6] kits though I believe the <abbr>AM</abbr>/<abbr>FM</abbr> antenna in those kits is identical to the AFHD-4.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="location" aria-labelledby="location.label">
    <h2 id="location.label">Antenna Location</h2>
    <p>Generally the higher the antenna, the better the reception will be. However there are some considerations.</p>
    <p>The highest possible install point at our home would be the chimney. The chimney is also farthest from obvious possible sources of electrical noise at our home. However the chimney is on the south-east side of the home and the grounding rod is on the north-west side of the home. Properly <a href="bond_earth_ground.xhtml">earthing</a> the antenna would not be possible.</p>
    <p>The next best location height-wise would be at the roof peak on the west side of the home. It could be earthed there, but installing the mast and antenna would be expensive because it would require a professional installer. I simply do not feel comfortable climbing that high on a ladder that would have to be fairly steep due to the fence location with our neighbor.</p>
    <p>There are some fake windows along the north side of the roof. Properly (in code compliance) earthing the antenna there though may not be possible, I am not sure. That location also could be considered an eye-sore generating complaints from neighbors.</p>
    <p>The location I did choose is on the west side of the house where the house roof meets the garage roof.</p>
    <p>This location is fairly close to the grounding rod. It is set back from the street so that the antenna is barely visible from the street. The required ladder does need need to go as high. It is also close to three of the four rooms that will have <abbr>AM</abbr>/<abbr>FM</abbr> receivers. As a bonus there is also already an existing mast for an ancient <abbr>TV</abbr> satellite that we do not use, that mast can be repurposed.</p>
    <p>The downside to that location is that there is a fluorescent ballast in that garage and it is fairly close to our wireless router, both of which are potential sources of <abbr>AM</abbr> interference.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="splitter" aria-labelledby="splitter.label">
    <h2 id="splitter.label">Splitting the Signal</h2>
    <p>If you do not need to split the signal to service more than one tuner, <a href="#coax">skip ahead to Coaxial Cable</a>.</p>
    <p>If you are only interested in broadcast <abbr>FM</abbr>&#8212;you can use the same kind of splitters, amplified distributors, and preamplifiers you would use with a television antenna install. However there are some television preamplifiers that filter out the <abbr>FM</abbr> band, so avoid those.</p>
    <p>The frequency band used by broadcast <abbr>AM</abbr> is way too low for most splitters and amplifiers. You <em>must</em> use splitters specifically designed to accomodate 0.55 MHz (550 KHz) at the bottom end. Also, if you are distributing SiriusXM as well, you need a splitter than handles up to 2400 MHz (2.4 GHz). Many splitters and aplified distributors for television do handle 2400 MHz but some only handle up to about 1000 MHz.</p>
    <p>The Pixel Technologies <a href="https://pixelsatradio.com/collections/am-fm-products/products/pixel-mbs-4-siriusxm-multi-band-splitter" title="Internet Resource">MBS-4 Multi-band Splitter</a> is designed specifically for the 0.5&#8211;2400 MHz frequency wide-band.</p>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Any output that is not used should have a 75Ω termination cap.</p>
    <section id="preamp" aria-labelledby="preamp.label">
      <h3 id="preamp.label"><abbr>AM</abbr> Compatible Inline Amplifier</h3>
      <p>Amplifiers typically used for broadcast and satellite televion <strong>WILL NOT WORK</strong> for an <abbr>AM</abbr> band radio signal.</p>
      <p>To amplify a coaxial signal carrying <abbr>AM</abbr> radio, use the Pixel Technologies <a href="https://pixelsatradio.com/products/ultra-wide-band-line-amplifier-for-am-fm-hd-radio-over-the-air-tv-and-satellite-radio" title="Internet Resource">MBA-12 Inline Amplifier</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Do not buy the Pixel Technologies SBA-1 inline amplifier by mistake. It is cheaper but it is specific to the frequency band used by SiriusXM (2320&#8211;2345 MHz). It will not work with either <abbr>AM</abbr> or <abbr>FM</abbr> frequencies.</p>
      <p>The MBA-12 amplifier should be placed as close to the antenna as possible to reduce the amplification of noise that enters the signal after the signal leaves the antenna.</p>
      <p>To power the MBA-12, you will need a Pixel Technologies <a href="https://pixelsatradio.com/collections/power-accessories/products/pixel-technologies-siriusxm-5vdc-power-inserter-kit-ps-1" title="Internet Resource">PS-1 Power Inserter</a>. That power inserter comes with a coaxial insertion adapter that has one F connector that connects to the coaxial line coming from the antenna/amplifier, one F connector that would lead to the radio/splitter, and one F connector that connects to the 5V DC transformer (power brick). However if you are not using all four outputs on the MBS-4 splitter, you can also just feed the 5V power adapter to an unused output on the MBS-4 splitter. I do however still recommend using the inserter and terminating unused outputs.</p>
      <p>The power inserter should be inside the home even if the MBA-12 is outside the home. A coaxial grounding block between the MBA-12 and the PS-1 (where the coaxial line enters the home) will not hamper the operation of the amplifier. The DC voltage runs along the copper core, not the shielding that is what the grounding block bonds to the grounding rod.</p>
      <p>Please note that the power supply is 5 volts. The 12 volt power supplies sometimes used with television preamplifiers and amplified distributors may work but may be too much. When using the PS-1 to also power SiriusXM hardware I <em>believe</em> only using 5 volts is required but I <em>might</em> be wrong about that, I do not use SiriusXM. Anyway, just use the 5V DC transformer the PS-1 comes with.</p>

  <section id="coax" aria-labelledby="coax.label">
    <h2 id="coax.label">Coaxial Cable</h2>
    <p>For <abbr>FM</abbr> radio you <em>should</em> use quad-shield RG-6 but you can often get away with dual-shield, especially for things like short runs from the wall plate to the receiver.</p>
    <p>With <abbr>AM</abbr> radio however quad-shield RG-6 really is a <strong>MUST</strong> for every part of the run.</p>
    <p>It is perfectly fine to use copper clad steel core from the MBS-4 splitter to your destinations, RF does not benefit from solid core copper. Everything that carries voltage from the PS-1 transformer to the MBA-12 amplifier really should be the more expensive solid core copper RG-6 <em>if you can find it without needing to buy excessive amounts</em>. Most people who use copper clad steel do not report any issues but for carrying voltage, the solid copper core is technically superior.</p>
    <p>For the <abbr>FM</abbr> broadcast band RG-6 loses just under 3 dB of signal strength for every 100 feet. The total coaxial run length from the antenna to the stereo receiver should therefore be kept under 200 feet and the shorter the better. Longer runs may require more amplification than what is supplied by the MBA-12.</p>
    <p>With the broadcast <abbr>AM</abbr> band the signal loss is far less, only about &#8531; dB is lost per 100 feet. Signal loss due to coaxial length is not really a problem for <abbr>AM</abbr> frequencies. However when <em>amplifying the signal for <abbr>FM</abbr></em> then <abbr>AM</abbr> does in fact become a problem because you <strong>must</strong> use an amplifier designed for the <abbr>AM</abbr> frequency band.</p>
    <p>When runs over 200 feet are involved that include both <abbr>AM</abbr> and <abbr>FM</abbr>, if there is a problem with <abbr>FM</abbr> reception you can try installing a second MBA-12 inline with the first. It appears that you only need one power inserter to power two MBA-12 amplifiers installed in series but I have not tried that configuration.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="bandsplit" aria-labelledby="bandsplit.label">
    <h2 id="bandsplit.label">Receiver Connection</h2>
    <p>At the coaxial endpoint, if you are only interested in <abbr>FM</abbr> you can just attach the coaxial cable at the end of the run to the 75Ω coaxial female F-connector antenna jack on the <abbr>FM</abbr> tuner. Some <abbr>FM</abbr> tuners designed for use with a folded dipole antenna expect a twin lead 300Ω impedance connection. In those cases you will need a 75Ω to 300Ω balun adapter. They are pretty cheap and are available from a wide variety of sources. For the Bose Wave Radio and possibly some other receivers, you will need a Female F connector to Male 3.5mm &#8539;" adapter. The Bose Wave Radio still expects 75Ω impedence so a balun transformer is not needed.</p>
    <p>For receiving both <abbr>AM</abbr> and <abbr>FM</abbr> broadcasts the bands need to be split. This is done with the Pixel Technologies <a href="https://pixelsatradio.com/products/am-fm-band-separator" title="Internet Resource">AMFMBS-1 Band Separator</a>. If (and only if) you are also using the same coaxial run for SiriusXM Satelite Radio, you would <em>instead</em> want the <a href="https://pixelsatradio.com/collections/am-fm-products/products/am-fm-satellite-radio-triplexer" title="Internet Resource">AFST-1 Triplexer</a>.</p>
    <p>The <abbr>FM</abbr> output can then attach to your tuner <abbr>FM</abbr> antenna input and the <abbr>AM</abbr> output can then attach to your <abbr>AM</abbr> antenna input. However, receivers do not typically come with an F-connector antenna jack for <abbr>AM</abbr>. You will almost certainly need to use a <a href="https://pixelsatradio.com/products/am-twin-lead-adaptor-for-am-antenna-terminals" title="Internet Resource">Twin Lead Adaptor for <abbr>AM</abbr> Antenna Terminals</a>.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately there are several different methods of attaching an <abbr>AM</abbr> antenna to a receiver. Many if not most current receivers do use spring clip connectors, such as what is shown in the <a href="#figure.stereo">Opening Figure</a> of the back of my analog receiver. Those work fine with the twin lead adapter.</p>
    <p>Other tuners use other types of connectors for the <abbr>AM</abbr> antenna, an old tuner of mine had a two-pin <abbr>JST</abbr> connector for example. You will have to wire such a connector to the twin leads youself in those cases. The connector often just snaps on to the wire though you may need to cut the unshielded lead length.</p>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Any endpoint that is not used should have a 75Ω termination cap, whether it is at the room wall plate or an unused port on the AMFMBS-1 band seperator or the AFST-1 Triplexer. Otherwise signal may degrade for other endpoints.</p>

      <p>If you are also running SiriusXM on the same coax, then instead you would want the Pixel Technologies <a href="https://pixelsatradio.com/collections/siriusxm-satellite-radio-splitter-kits/products/pixel-afst-1-multi-band-signal-separator-for-am-fm-sirius-xm-radio-signals" title="Internet Resource">AFST-1 Multi-band Signal Separator Kit</a>.

    <h2 id="sat.label">SiriusXM Expansion</h2>
    <p>If you initially wire your coaxial runs using components that can handle up to 2400 MHz (2.4 GHz), whether using the AFHD-4 antenna or if just using an <abbr>FM</abbr> only antenna, you can add SiriusXM in the future.</p>
    <p>Contact <a href="https://pixelsatradio.com/" title="Internet Resource">Pixel Technologies</a> to discuss which SiriusXM satellite antenna and receivers you wish to use (they offer a couple models of each) and how it can be combined with the signal from your existing antenna. Make sure in such a contact query to include wiring details of your existing coaxial run for radio, such as the part numbers for each point along the way (e.g. your splitter, amplifier, etc.) and if possible, the lengths of each coaxial run.</p>

    <h2 id="sangean.label">Sangean HDT-20 <abbr>AM</abbr>/<abbr>FM</abbr>/<abbr>HD</abbr> Tuner</h2>
    <p>For a digital radio experience in your home entertainment center, I recommend the <a href="https://www.sangean.com/products/product.asp?mid=198&amp;cid=3" title="Internet Resource">Sangean HDT-20</a>. There are other options of course, but that model has the 17" width common for components installed within a home entertainment center.</p>
    <p>The Sangean HDT-20 will pick up analog radio for stations that do not yet broadcast in digital and for stations that do broadcast digital, it will of course use the digital signal and also provide any additional digital only content from side-stations broadcast on the same frequency.</p>
    <p>The back of the unit has a standard 75Ω coaxial female F-connector antenna jack for <abbr>FM</abbr> reception and it has push-pin connectors for <abbr>AM</abbr> reception that work perfectly with the Twin Lead Adaptor for <abbr>AM</abbr> Antenna Terminals.</p>
    <p>Historically, stereo system <abbr>AM</abbr>/<abbr>FM</abbr> tuners were also receivers with speaker wiring jacks. With digital audio the industry is now moving away from that model and that actually makes sense. Digital receivers are usually designed for digital video as well as digital audio.</p>
    <p>The Sangean HDT-20 is <em>just a tuner</em>. It requires the use of a <em>separate</em> receiver to amplify the audio and send it to your speakers, though there is a headphone jack on the front.</p>
    <p>The unit does have left and right <abbr>RCA</abbr> analog audio output jacks if your audio receiver is not yet digital, but it also has both optical and coaxial <abbr>SPDIF</abbr> audio outputs for a digital audio receiver.</p>
    <p>Please note that the Sangean HDT-20 is not a SiriusXM receiver. It would be nice to have a single component that does both Analog and Digital <abbr>AM</abbr>/<abbr>FM</abbr> as well as SiriusXM but there may not be enough market demand for mass manufacture a single component that does all of that as patent licenses in addition to parts would add to the manufacturing costs. I despise how long patents last, that hurts both innovation and the consumer (<em>opinion</em>).</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="teste" aria-labelledby="teste.label">
    <h2 id="teste.label">Test Environment</h2>
    <p>I decided to test the benefits of the AFHD-4 antenna in my specific environment. This test is somewhat limited in scope. Results performing a similar test at the same house but with a different antenna install location could vary significantly.</p>
    <p>An inexpensive &#8216;Antop AT-212FM Curved Panel Amplified Indoor <abbr>AM</abbr>/<abbr>FM</abbr> Antenna&#8217; connected directly to the test analog tuner/receiver is used as the reference antenna. I chose that as my reference antenna because it is a decent quality yet inexpensive indoor antenna which has better reception than the junk antennas that currently ships bundled with a tuner (usually just a piece of wire for <abbr>FM</abbr> and a wire loop mounted inside cheap plastic for <abbr>AM</abbr>.)</p>
    <p>My analog only Yamaha R-S201 receiver will be used to test how many stations on both bands are received for most of the tests. The very last test will use a <a href="#sangean">Sangean HDT-20</a> digital tuner to test the signal strength on the longest run from the splitter as well as which stations broadcasting digital radio are picked up as digital radio.</p>
    <p>During all tests <em>except for the final interference tests</em> the fluorescent ballast in the garage adjacent to test room and antenna location, my <abbr>PC</abbr>, my <abbr>television</abbr>, and the <abbr>WiFi</abbr> router will all be turned off as they are all possible sources of interference. The two final tests will test the performance of the antenna system with those possible sources of interference turned on, but my television will be muted.</p>
    <p>Due to physical logistics, the tests can not be performed all on the same day so it is possible atmospheric difference can impact the results. All tests will be started at 1:00 <abbr>A.M.</abbr> when reception is typically very good.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="tests" aria-labelledby="tests.label">
    <h2 id="tests.label">The Tests</h2>
    <p>The test results are presented in a table with row of data indicating the frequency, call letters, heading, distance, transmission power (if known), and inidividual test quality. Quality will simply indicate &#8216;N&#8217; for &#8216;Null&#8217;, &#8216;H&#8217; for &#8216;Horrid&#8217;, &#8216;P&#8217; for &#8216;Poor&#8217;, or &#8216;G&#8217; for &#8216;Good&#8217;.</p>
    <p>A rating of &#8216;Null&#8217; indicates I could not tell a station was there. A rating of &#8216;Horrid&#8217; indicates I can tell a station is there but I can not make any content out. A rating of &#8216;Poor&#8217; indicates I can make out the content but the audio quality leaves a lot to be desired. A rating of &#8216;Good&#8217; indicates the content is clearly audible.</p>
    <p>The following five tests will be performed:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt id="reftest">Reference:</dt>
        <dd>Antop AT-212FM is connected directly to the analog receiver. This is to provide a reference for the performance of the AFHD-4 at my chosen install location relative to a less expensive but decent quality small indoor antenna.</dd>
      <dt id="test1">Test 1:</dt>
        <dd>The AFHD-4 Antenna is connected directly to the receiver without any amplification or splitting. A coaxial line will run straight from the antenna through my window to my receiver. This is to provide a reference for the capabilities of the AFHD-4 at my chosen install location.</dd>
      <dt id="test2">Test 2:</dt>
        <dd>The AFHD-4 Antenna signal is passed through the MBS-4 four-way splitter but the amplifier is bypassed, no signal amplification. This is to give a picture of what is lost as a result of unamplified signal splitting.</dd>
      <dt id="test3">Test 3:</dt>
        <dd>The AFHD-4 Antenna signal is passed through the MBS-4 four-way splitter with MBA-12 amplifier powered by the PS-1 power inserter. This is to guage whether or not the MBA-12 adds sufficient amplification for the splits and additional coaxial length involved.</dd>
      <dt id="test4">Test 4:</dt>
        <dd>The AFHD-4 Antenna signal is passed through the MBS-4 four-way splitter with MBA-12 amplifier powered by the PS-1 power inserter and possible sources of interference are active. This is to guage how potential sources of interference impact my intended installation location.</dd>
      <dt id="test5">Test 5:</dt>
        <dd>The AFHD-4 Antenna signal is passed through the MBS-4 four-way splitter with MBA-12 amplifier powered by the PS-1 power inserter and possible sources of interference are active. Rather than testing with the analog receiver attached to a short run from the splitter, the test is performed with a digital tuner attached to the longest run from the splitter. In this test, stations received as digital audio will have a &#8216;(DA)&#8217; after the rating code. Stations that should be received as digital but were only tuned as analog with have a &#8216;(AA)&#8217; after the rating code. Stations that only broadcast in analog will not have either after the rating code.</dd>

The radio frequency signal, abbreviated as RF, enters the coaxial system from an AFHD-4 antenna. The RF signal then enters and exits a surge surpressor before entering an MBA 12 amplifier where the RF signal is amplified by about 12 decibels. After leaving the amplifier, the RF signal enters a coaxial grounding block which is electrically bonded to the earth through a grounding rod. The RF signal leaves the grounding block where it then enters a PS-1 Power Inserter that supplies the 5 volts of direct current voltage needed by the previously mentioned MBA 12 amplifier. The RF signal leaves the PS-1 Power Inserter where it then enters a MBS-4 signal splitter to be split four ways. The first split from the MBS-4 enters an AMFMBS-1 RF signal separator, where the AM and FM bands are split into distinct RF signals which feed the AM and FM antenna inputs on a Yamaha R-S201 receiver. The second split from the MBS-4 does not have the frequency bands splits, it just enters the FM antenna port on a Bose Wave. The third split from the MBS-4 is currently terminated by a 75Ω termination cap to be used for a radio in the future. The fourth split from the MBS-4 enters a second AMFMBS-1 signal separator where the AM and FM bands are separated to feed the AM and FM antenna inputs on a Sangean HDT-20 tuner.

  <p>All coaxial cable from the Antenna to the MBS-4 is quad shield solid core copper. The runs from the MBS-4 to the coaxial jacks in the wall use quad shield copper clad steel as they do not carry any <abbr>DC</abbr> voltage.</p>
  <p>Allegedly the MBS-4 has a 12 dB signal loss per output opposed to the 7&#8211;8 dB typical of 4-way splitters designed for the smaller television band. In essence, that means MBA-12 compensates for the splitter but does not compensate for cable length.</p>
  <p>I do not know what the dB signal loss is for the AMFMBS-1 band splitter.</p>
