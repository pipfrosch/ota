  <h1 id="radio.label"><abbr>AM</abbr>/<abbr>FM</abbr> Radio</h1>
  <p>Television is not the only source of news and entertainment that uses radio transmissions that are free to receive. <abbr>AM</abbr> and <abbr>FM</abbr> radio predate television considerably and are both still very much alive.</p>
  <p>Please note that if you are <em>only</em> interested in <abbr>FM</abbr> radio, things are somewhat simpler. The <abbr>FM</abbr> band fallse between <abbr>VHF-Lo</abbr> and <abbr>VHF-Hi</abbr> and most modern radio tuners with antenna input use the same 75Ω coaxial female F-connector antenna jack that ATSC television uses.</p>

    <figcaption id="figure.stereo.label">The back of my Yamaha R-S201 receiver showing a 75Ω coaxial female F-connector antenna jack for <abbr>FM</abbr> and 300Ω two-wire antenna connector for <abbr>AM</abbr>.</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>This allows the same splitters and signal amplifiers that work with <abbr>OTA</abbr> television to also work with <abbr>FM</abbr> broadcast.</p>
  <p>In fact for <abbr>FM</abbr> radio, if your antenna&#8212;such as many but not all Yagi-Uda antennas&#8212;works with both <abbr>VHF-Lo</abbr> and <abbr>VHF-Hi</abbr> there is a good possibility it also works well for <abbr>FM</abbr>, at least for <abbr>FM</abbr> broadcast from the same direction for which the antenna is pointed.</p>
  <p>In theory you can use a combiner to combine the output of an <abbr>FM</abbr> antenna with your television antenna but in practice that is not very realistic. <abbr>ATSC</abbr> tuners do not decode <abbr>FM</abbr> signals (analog or digital) so you would lose about 4 dB when combining the signal only to lose about 4 dB again when you split the signal to feed both an <abbr>ATSC</abbr> tuner and an <abbr>FM</abbr> tuner. That is a 7&#8211;8 dB loss.</p>
  <p>If you also want <abbr>AM</abbr> radio, <abbr>AM</abbr> broadcasts from 550&#8211;1720 kHz (0.55&#8211;1.72 MHz) which unfortunately is well below the operational range for amplifiers and splitters that are used for <abbr>OTA</abbr> television.</p>
  <p>This appendix chapter will discuss setting up an <abbr>AM</abbr>/<abbr>FM</abbr> antenna distributed to multiple receivers via coaxial cable along with notes about setting up a similar system that is <abbr>FM</abbr> only.</p>
  <section id="test" aria-labelledby="test.label">
    <h2 id="test.label">Test Environment</h2>
    <p>An inexpensive &#8216;Antop AT-212FM Curved Panel Amplified Indoor <abbr>AM</abbr>/<abbr>FM</abbr> Antenna&#8217; connected directly to the test receiver will be used as a reference antenna.</p>
    <p>My analog only Yamaha R-S201 receiver will be used to test how many stations on both bands are received, and how well they come in. As such digital <abbr>AM</abbr>/<abbr>FM</abbr> reception will not be tested.</p>
    <p>During the tests, my <abbr>PC</abbr>, <abbr>television</abbr>, and <abbr>WiFi</abbr> router will be turned off as they are all possible sources of interference <em>except</em> in the final test.</p>
    <p>Due to physical logistics, the tests can not be performed all on the same day so it is possible atmospheric difference can impact the results. All tests will be performed between the hours of 1:00 <abbr>A.M.</abbr> and 3:00 <abbr>A.M.</abbr> when reception is typically very good.</p>
