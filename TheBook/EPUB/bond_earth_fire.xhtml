  <h1 id="chapter.label">Bonding, Earthing, and Grounding</h1>
  <p>There is an old saying, &#8220;All Roads Lead to Rome.&#8212;</p>
  <p>A similar thing can be said for electrical current outside of a controlled circuit. &#8220;All Paths Lead to Earth.&#8212;</p>
  <p>The semantics discussed here are related to how we let current ouside a circuit and thus seeking the Earth reach it as safely as possible.</p>
  <p>In the context of an <strong>outdoor</strong> antenna install, the term &#8216;grounding*#8217; that is used means something different than what most people think of when they hear the term &#8216;grounding*#8217; and it is different from uses of the term &#8216;grounding*#8217; in other contexts. Different meanings to the term &#8216;grounding*#8217; that are within the context of electrical current can cause confusion in understanding, and that confusion that I believe can be dangerous.</p>
  <p>For that reason, I will be using a <em>different</em> term &#8216;earthing&#8217; for one of the meanings and the term &#8216;bond to ground&#8217; for a another meaning but continue to use the term &#8216;grounding&#8217; in a more limited scope. This I hope will help avoid confusion. The NEC actually considered using the term &#8216;earthing&#8217; at one point themselves but the proposal did not seem to make it into their publications. The term &#8216;bond to ground&#8217; I do see used fairly often elsewhere, though I do not know if the NEC uses it.</p>

    <h2 id="bonding.label">Bonding</h2>
    <p><dfn>Bonding</dfn> is placing a highly conductive path (frequently a solid core copper wire) between two conductive objects so that they do not have any potential voltage between them.</p>

      <figcaption id="figure.bonding.label">Two pipes bonded together with a solid core wire.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>In that image, those two water pipes are bonded together with a rather thick solid unshielded wire. If water flowing through the pipes results in the buildup of static potential voltage, the two pipes will not have a potential voltage between them because they are properly bonded. Any charge that builds up in one pipe is shared with the other through the bonding wire so that there is no voltage drop across the bonding wire.</p>
    <p>When bonding two conductive objects, the wire used to bond them should be sufficient for the potential voltage difference they may have without bonding.</p>
    <p>One way to think about it is like water in fish tanks. If you have two 10 gallon tanks next to each other and one is only 10% full while the other is 90% full, you can place plastic tubing full of water between them and they will level out to where they a both 50% full.</p>
    <p>As long as air does not get into the tubing, adding water two one adds water to both and removing water from one removes water from both, they are bonded together.</p>
    <p>However if the plastic tubing is of a very small diameter, the flow between the two tanks is reduced which can result in overflow should you add water to one too quickly before it has the chance to pass some of the gained water to the other.</p>
    <p>Always follow NEC guidelines, when available, to determine the proper guage of wire to use. Also, remember that higher guage wire is thinner than lower guage wire. Also, always use solid core wire for bonding, stranded wire is susceptible to breakage as it ages.</p>

  <section id="earthing" aria-labelledby="earthing.label">
    <h2 id="earthing.label">Earthing</h2>
    <p><dfn>Earthing</dfn> is placing a conductive path (frequently a THICK solid core copper wire) that allows current to flow from a conductive object into the Earth.</p>
    <p>When earthing is done by NEC standards, one or typically two ground rods at least 8 feet in height are placed at least 8 feet deep into the earth.</p>
    <p>When only one ground rod is used it must have less than 25Ω of resistance and most inspectors will require witnessing the test to demonstrate that measurement, a test that involves very expensive equipment and skill to perform. When two ground rods are used that are least six feet apart <em>and</em> are properly bonded to each other, the inspector knows that there will be less than 25Ω of resistance and can approve the ground rods without needing to see the test, so in modern construction that is what is typically done simply because it is faster to pass inspection even if one ground rod would have been enough.</p>
    <p>As the ground rod itself is a conductive object, you now have two conductive objects with with a highly conductive path between them. Thus in addition to providing a path for current to flow from a conductive object into the earth, earthing also is bonding a conductive object to the ground rod.</p>
    <p>NEC requires that the ground circuit from your main electrical panel (and the metal panel housing) be earthed to the grounding rod, providing a path for power surges and shorts to ground within your home to flow into the earth. As such, even if you can not see it, the grounding rod will be located near your main electrical panel. The ground circuit within in your home is thus also bonded to the ground rod.</p>
    <p>All ground rods used at your house <strong>MUST</strong> be properly bonded together so that they do not have any potential voltage between them. The reason for this is that the earth itself is not very conductive, so the earth itself does not do a good job at bonding different ground rods. During a lightening storm, one part of the earth may have a significantly different potential voltage than another and it may take some time for their potential voltage to even out.</p>
    <p>Cows have literally been killed not because the cow itself was struck by lightening, but because lightening struck <em>near</em> the cow resulting in a voltage potential difference between one part of the earth the cow is standing on (point A) and another part of the earth the cow is standing on (point B). When the cow is more conductive than the earth under it, current will flow through the cow to get from point A to B rather than through the earth, often killing the cow. Stay inside during lightening storms and if you are caught outsise in one, keep your feet close together.</p>
    <p>If you have multiple ground rods connected to equipment on your home, likewise your home may become the path of least resistance for current to flow in an electrical storm if those ground rods are not properly bonded with each other. Do not just install a ground rod where you want your antenna, but instead install your antenna where there is easy access to an existing ground that is either the same ground rod used for your house wiring or that you know for a fact is properly bonded to the ground rod used for your house wiring.</p>
    <p>Adding another ground rod can be done, but to be done <em>safely</em> it needs to be done by a licensed electrician and be inspected by a proper official before it can be used. Installing a ground rod is not a <abbr title="Do It Yourself">DIY</abbr> project.</p>
    <hr class="half" />
    <p>When NEC (or other) specifications and documents talk about grounding something to a ground rod, what they mean is what I have defined here as &#8216;earthing&#8217;&#8212;providing a highly conductive path for current to flow directly to the earth <em>without</em> passing through the home wiring (or people in the home, or wood framing in the home) to get there.</p>
    <p>Earthing is protection from sudden voltage spikes the home wiring may not be able to handle. In the context of antennas, that current spike would be caused by a lightening strike. Generally 10 AWG or thicker copper is used, the earthing wire should be as short as possible, and should not have any sharp bends in it.</p>

    <h2 id="grounding.label">Grounding and Bonding to Ground</h2>
    <p><dfn>Grounding</dfn> is placing a conductive path (frequently a solid core copper wire) that allows current to flow from a conductive object to the house ground circuit.</p>
    <p>However, I do make a distinction between grounding and &#8216;bonding to ground&#8217;.</p>
    <p>In the photograph of the metal pipes, if one of those pipes is bonded to ground elsewhere then the other pipe is now also bonded to ground.</p>
    <p>On the other hand for appliances that receive alternating current from a circuit in the house, such as my PC with its metal case, they should have a conductive wire connected directly to the grounding wire provided by that circuit. That is what I refer to as &#8216;grounding&#8217;.</p>
    <p>It is to some extent a semantic difference but I believe it to be an important one. Any electrical appliance with a conductive surface that we touch should be grounded to the ground wire <em>from that same circuit that powers it</em>. This is done with a grounded plug, such as the three-prong plugs with 120V AC circuits.</p>
    <p>In some very old houses, not all of the circuits have a ground wire. If you live in such a home, it is imperative that you hire a qualified electrician to rewire the house so that all circuits have a proper ground wire. Such houses also often have cloth wiring, another danger that is imperative to fix. If poverty is getting in the way of rewiring an older home, some jurisdictions have programs to help fund the cost of rewiring older homes. Your local fire department may be able to direct you to them.</p>
    <p>During the 1980s some of our outlets in the home I lived in were not grounded outlets. The metal boxes for those outlets were in fact bonded to ground and we could plug appliances into them using a three-prong to two-prong converter that screwed into the outlet plate cover, providing an electrical path to ground for the third prong. It worked, however if the outlet box lost its bond to ground, then the third prong would no longer be a path to ground.</p>
    <p>With a grounded circuit, the ground wire from the NM sheathed electrical cable (often called Romex though that is actually a brand name) is wired directly to the third prong receptacle and is much less likely to come undone. With a grounded appliance, the conductive surfaces of the appliance that we might touch are bonded to the ground prong and are only properly grounded when that ground prong is plugged into a grounded outlet. That to me is what actually counts as being &#8216;grounded&#8217; rather than just being &#8216;bonded to ground&#8217;.</p>
    <p>The distinction I make to some may be purely academic but to me the distinction is a matter of safety.</p>
    <p>Just to note, my father did renovate the wiring in that house when money allowed so that it had grounded circuits throughout and a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupy (GFCI or GFI) in the bathroom and kitchen (which happened to be the same circuit). He wanted to add arc-detecting circuit breakers but the breaker box did not support them and replacing the breaker box with one that did was out of our price range. Off topic but that is one of the reasons I have socialist leanings. Life saving advances in technology should not be restricted by socio-economic class.</p>

    <h2 id="summary.label">Summary</h2>
    <p><dfn>Bonding</dfn> is placing a highly conductive path (frequently a solid core copper wire) between two conductive objects so that they do not have any potential voltage between them.</p>
    <p><dfn>Earthing</dfn> is placing a conductive path (frequently a THICK solid core copper wire) that allows current to flow from a conductive object into the Earth.</p>
    <p>When a conductive object is earthed, it is <em>directly</em> bonded to the ground rod <em>without</em> the wire passing through the house.</p>
    <p><dfn>Bonding to Ground</dfn> is placing a highly conductive path <em>for low amperage use cases that are not powered by a house wiring circuit</em> between a conductive object and a second conductive object that is either earthed or bonded to ground itself. Bonding to ground is acceptable when the conductive object is not as risk of a lightening strike or other high power surge and when the conductive object is not powered by an electrical circuit. A conductive object that is bonded to ground will not have a potential voltage difference with the ground rod.</p>
    <p><dfn>Grounding</dfn> is placing a highly conductive path between a conductive object (usually a conductive surface) associated with a powered appliance and the ground wire associated with the circuit that provides electrical current to that appliance. A conductive object that is grounded will not have a potential voltage difference with the ground rod.</p>
    <p>Ultimately all four terms describe providing a path for current outside a controlled circuit to get to the Earth, but they are different concepts that should not be confused with each other.</p>

    <h2 id="notes.label">Notes</h2>
    <p>Prior to <time>2011</time> some houses used the incoming water main as the ground rod. I <em>believe</em> that is no longer allowed for any new construction since then.</p>
    <p>If your water main is within five feet of your main electric panel, the NEC does allow it to be used as a ground rod for the purpose of earthing an antenna mast and the coaxial cable coming from the antenna mast. If there is an accessible ground rod available there, however, I would recommend using that for any earthing needs.</p>

      <figcaption id="figure.watermain.label">This house was built in 2001 and either does not have an actual ground rod or the ground rod is completely burried and is not accessible. However since the water main is within five feet of the main electrical box, the water main could be used as a ground rod. Paint would have to be scraped off before attaching the clamps for the earthing wires from an antenna.</figcaption>
