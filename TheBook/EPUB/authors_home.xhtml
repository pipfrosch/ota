  <p>If you have the financial ability to do so without going into debt, I recommend you do as much as possible at a single go. However when you do not have the financial ability to do so, the project can be broken up into stages to allow financial recovery from one stage before investing in the next stage.</p>
  <p>Doing things in stages still can allow you to start saving money by elimination the cable bill early. This was our plan, and hopefully it will inspire someone else to figure out how to do something similar.</p>

    <h2 id="home.label">Brief Description of Our Home</h2>
    <p>The house is a five bedroom single story house with an attic.</p>
    <p>From the point of view of a compass, the front of our house points roughly 30° West of North (330° heading) but I will just call it North. When you are standing in the front driveway facing the house, there is an &#8216;East Garage&#8217; to your left and a &#8216;West Garage&#8217; to your right. The grounding rod is on the outside west side of the west garage.</p>
    <p>As you enter the home, there is a &#8216;East Entry Room&#8217; to your left and a &#8216;West Entry Room&#8217; to your right. As you pass the entry rooms, you cross a hallways that goes from the east side of the house to the west side of the house. Continue across that hallway and you enter a large open space with the kitchen towards the right (west) and the living room to the left (east). On the east wall of the living room is an alcove with an entertainment center in it.</p>
    <p>When you enter the house and passing the entry rooms, if you turn right (west) it leads to what I call the &#8216;West Wing&#8217; which has a hallway that runs north to south. At the south side of the &#8216;West Wing&#8217; is the Master Bedroom. It has an outside wall on its south and west. At the north side of the &#8216;West Wing&#8217; is the North West bedroom. It has an outside will on its west, and shares a wall with the West Garage on its north side. The south side shares a wall with the closet of the Master Bedroom. The North West bedroom is where the broadband Internet modem is, along with the wireless router for the house.</p>
    <p>When you enter the house and passing the entry rooms, if you turn left (east) it leads to what I call the &#8216;East Wing&#8217; which has a hallway that runs north to south. At the south side of the &#8216;East Wing&#8217; is the South East bedroom. It has an outside wall on its south and east. At the north side of the &#8216;East Wing&#8217; is the North East bedroom. It has an outside wall on its east, its south wall is shared with the East Garage. Between those two rooms is a bedroom room we call the &#8216;Sewing Room&#8217;.</p>

    <h2 id="ota.label">Over The Air Reception Plan</h2>
    <p>For television, we wanted <abbr>OTA</abbr> broadcasts available in all five of the bedrooms, the living room, and an additional run for a WiFi accessible <abbr>DVR</abbr>. The logical place to install a WiFi accessible <abbr>DVR</abbr> is in the North West bedroom because that is where the home router is located.</p>
    <p>This means three coaxial runs to the &#8216;West Wing&#8217; (two bedrooms plus the WiFi accessible <abbr>DVR</abbr>) and four coaxial runs to the &#8216;East Wing&#8217; (three bedrooms plus living room entertainment center).</p>
    <p>Strategically, this is best accomplished with a three-way passive splitter in the attic for the &#8216;West Wing&#8217; and a four-way passive splitter in the attic from the &#8216;East Wing&#8217;. Those two splitters would them be fed by a two-way amplified distributor which is fed by the antenna. We toyed with the idea of just using two antennas installed in the attic&#8212;one for each wing&#8212;and no amplification. However when taking a look inside the attic, <abbr>HVAC</abbr> ducts with their shiny reflective coatings made me change my mind on that plan. The two antennas would still have to be fairly close to each other physically to both point in proper direction with least risk of interference, so we decided a amplified two-way splitter was best.</p>
    <p>For radio, we (mostly me) wanted <abbr>OTA</abbr> broadcasts available in the two &#8216;West Wing&#8217; bedrooms, the West Entry Room, and the living room entertainment center. A total of four coaxial runs.</p>
    <p>Strategically, this is best accomplished with an outdoor antenna installed where the west side of the house meets the West Garage as that location allows easy access to the grounding rod. A four-way splitter would then provide relatively short coaxial runs to the three runs on the west side, with a single longer run to the west side. As some of the radio stations are distant, the radio run needs amplification even with just a four-way split. Amplified distributors that work in the <abbr>AM</abbr> frequency band either do not exist or are difficult to find, so an inline amplifier was decided upon.</p>
    <p>Power for both the television antenna amplified distributor and the radio antenna amplifier would be supplied from the West Garage where it is relatively easy to troubleshoot or replace the transformer bricks if one or both of them fail in the future.</p>
    <p>Accomplishing all of this was broken down into a four phases in order to spread the financial burden without needing a lot of financing. Note that the money saved from just one year of cable television will more than pay for it, but there is still an upfront cost.</p>

  <section id="atsc.antenna" aria-labelledby="atsc.antenna.label">
    <h2 id="atsc.antenna.label"><abbr>ATSC</abbr> Antenna</h2>
    <p>As all transmission towsers we are interested in are within 25 miles and in the same general direction, we went with the <a href="https://store.antennasdirect.com/ClearStream-2MAX-Indoor-Outdoor-TV-Antenna.html" title="Internet Resource">ClearStream 2MAX®</a> along with the <a href="https://store.antennasdirect.com/ClearStream-2MAX-Reflector-Assembly-C2M-REF.html" title="Internet Resource">Reflector Assembly</a> for that model.</p>
    <p>The reflector assembly acts as a parasitic element for the <abbr>UHF</abbr> loop antennas, adding gain in the direction the antenna is pointed at the cost of reducing gain from other directions. It is that reduction of gain from other directions that compelled me to buy the reflector assembly, with an <abbr>HVAC</abbr> unit in the attic and with reflective <abbr>HVAC</abbr> ducts I wanted to reduce interference from directions in which we are not interested in receiving signal.</p>
    <section id="vhf.note" aria-labelledby="vhf.note.label">
      <h3 id="vhf.note.label"><abbr>VHF Note</abbr></h3>
      <p>Note that the previously mentioned reflector kit does not benefit <abbr>VHF</abbr> reception. It actually sits between the <abbr>VHF</abbr> dipole and the <abbr>UHF</abbr> double loop and is clearly engineered for the double loop.</p>
      <p><abbr>VHF</abbr> transmits with less power, the antenna has less gain for <abbr>VHF</abbr> (2.6 dBi versus 8.7 dBi) and the direction reflector only benefits <abbr>UHF</abbr>. <abbr>VHF</abbr> is sort-of an afterthought with this antenna setup.</p>
      <p>We have only one <abbr>VHF</abbr> channel of interest, <a href="https://www.kvie.org/" title="Internet Resource">KVIE</a> which uses virtual channels 6.1&#8211;6.4 but broadcasts on <abbr>VHF</abbr> channel 9 (189 MHz). The dipole that is part of the ClearStream 2MAX® has dipoles that are 15 inches in length, which is optimized for channel 10 (195 MHz) which is in the middle of the <abbr>VHF-Hi</abbr> band.</p>
      <p>When first testing the antenna in my bedroom, a channel scan saw the <abbr>VHF</abbr> KVIE channels but was not able to tune them. All of the <abbr>UHF</abbr> channels came in well. Installed in the attic, KVIE works but there are still occassional tuning problems.</p>
      <p>As <abbr>VHF</abbr> broadcast channel 9 is the only <abbr>VHF</abbr> frequency of interest, rather than spend ~ $140 on a <a href="https://store.antennasdirect.com/C5-Clearstream-5-vhf-uhf-long-range-outdoor-DTV-antenna.html" title="Internet Resource">ClearStream® 5 VHF</a> antenna to supplement the current antenna, I will build a homemade folded dipole antenna optimized for broadcast channel 9 (189 MHz) with its own reflector. Folded dipole antennas have roughly a 300Ω impedence so I will have to add a 300Ω to 75Ω balun but those are cheap. I can then use a signal combiner to combine the signals and that should solve the problem. Given that both antennas will be pointed in the same direction, I may need to use a low-pass filter on the <abbr>VHF</abbr> antenna and a high-pass filter on the <abbr>UHF</abbr> antenna to avoid signal cancellation. They would likely be installed on the same mast which may require buying a larger mast than what shipped with the ClearStream 2MAX®.</p>
      <p>It should be noted that while building a homemade folded dipole with more dBi gain than the ClearStream 2MAX® has for the <abbr>VHF</abbr> 189 MHz frequency is not difficult, there will be dB loss when combining the signal with the <abbr>UHF</abbr> frequencies from the ClearStream 2MAX®. What I am actually trying to achieve is a higher signal to noise ratio for that specific Channel 9 frequency band, that is what I <em>believe</em> is the actual issue. I <em>believe</em> a folded dipole of optimal size in combination with a parasitic reflector will accomplish just that.</p>

  <section id="radio.antenna" aria-labelledby="radio.antenna.label">
    <h2 id="radio.antenna.label"><abbr>AM</abbr>/<abbr>FM</abbr> Antenna</h2>
    <p>Had I only wanted <abbr>FM</abbr>, there would have been many options available including options that often work well inside an attic.</p>
    <p>As I wish to distribute <abbr>AM</abbr> as well as <abbr>FM</abbr>, other than trying to make such an antenna myself, the only real option I had was the <a href="https://pixelsatradio.com/collections/antennas/products/afhd-4-long-range-am-fm-hd-radio-antenna" title="Internet Resource">Pixel Technologies AFHD-4</a>.</p>
    <p>This antenna is a 48 inch (~ 122 cm) monopole whip antenna. For <abbr>FM</abbr> the length falls somewhere between a quarter-wave and a half-wave antenna, assuming the full 48 inches of the rod is used for the monopole.</p>
    <p>As a monopole antenna, it is omnidirectional and does not need to be aimed, but the omnidirectional nature also makes it susceptible to noise from any direction which can have a rather large impact to <abbr>AM</abbr> reception. As we do have an <abbr>HVAC</abbr> unit in the attic, an outdoor install was the best option.</p>
    <p>If <abbr>FM</abbr> had been all we were interested in, we <em>probably</em> would have tried a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FM-Loop-Antenna-Outdoor-Attic-mount/dp/B006SLV25C" title="Internet Resource"><abbr>FM</abbr> Loop Antenna</a> mounted in the attic and only moved it outside if interference was suspected of causing the reception to be unsatisfactory. With <abbr>AM</abbr> in play, I just assumed interference would be a problem with the start.</p>
  </section>


  <section id="phase1" aria-labelledby="phase1.label">
    <h2 id="phase1.label">Phase 1: West Wing</h2>
    <p>For this phase, the initial phase, the television antenna is installed in the attic and the coaxial runs for the bedroom in the &#8216;West Wing&#8217; are run. Even though the radio antenna is not installed yet, running the coaxial cable for radio in those two rooms makes sense as we will be using a single &#8216;low voltage&#8217; bracket for both of the televion and radio coaxial outputs.</p>
    <p>We could have also done the coaxial run for the radio in the West Entry Room at this point, but that room has a Bose Wave with the intent to install it permanently in wall of bookshelves that are being used as sort of a china cabinet. That would require finding which bookshelf has the outlet behind it, moving that bookshelf and drilling a hole in the back of the bookshelf, <abbr>etc.</abbr> so that was delayed until Phase 2.</p>
    <p>Phase 1 thus involves five coaxial runs, three from television and two for radio. Hardware required involves the antenna, the three-way passive splitter for television, the four-way passive splitter for radio, three &#8216;old work&#8217; 1 gang boxes, two &#8216;two port&#8217; wall inserts and one &#8216;one port&#8217; wall inserts. Along with cover plates. We also started the <abbr>Cat6</abbr> ethernet run for the fifth phase.</p>
    <p>A 250 foot pull box of quad-shield copper-clad steel core RG-6 coaxial cable along with compression connectors was also needed. 250 feet is excessive but the excess will be used.</p>
    <p>Also bought for Phase 1 were cable labels, staples for guiding the coaxial runs in the attic, and 75Ω termination caps.</p>
    <p>For the television 3-way passive splitter, the run for the <abbr>DVR</abbr> got the -3.5 dB output and the two runs for televisions got the -7 dB outputs. All outputs were used. For the radio 4-way passive splitter, only two outputs were used so two 75Ω termination caps were loosely (hand tight) put into the unused outputs just to protect them from possible moisture.</p>
    <p>After using a coaxial connection tester to verify conductivity between the splitter inputs and the wall jack outputs, 75Ω termination caps were placed into the radio output for the master bedroom and the <abbr>DVR</abbr> output in the North West bedroom. A 75Ω termination cap was loosely placed into the radio 4-way splitter input. A coaxial run was then made from the three-way splitter to the antenna, giving immediate <abbr>OTR</abbr> broadcast to the two television in the &#8216;West Wing&#8217; bedrooms.</p>
    <p>The following month, we were able to afford a four-tuner TablotTV &#8216;Tablo QUAD Over-The-Air DVR&#8217; and an external 1 TB <abbr>USB</abbr> drive. We went external just to make it easier to replace the hard drive if it failed. We could then completely eliminate the cable TV bill, streaming <abbr>OTA</abbr> content to the televisions without an antenna hookup.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="phase2" aria-labelledby="phase2.label">
    <h2 id="phase2.label">Phase 2: Amplifier Power</h2>
    <p>With no more cable bill, financial recovery from the Phase 1 expense did not take long.</p>
    <p>For phase 2, we installed the coaxial runs needed to provide signal amplification for both broadcast television and broadcast radio, the two-way amplified distributor we would need to bring signal to the &#8216;West Wing&#8217;, and also the radio coaxial run for the West Entry Room.</p>
    <p>As the planned installation of the future radio antenna is on the west side of the house, using the West Garage as the location for the amplifier power bricks made the most sense. We could have run Romex in the attic but power transformers sometimes fail, I did not want to have to climb up into the attic just to troubleshoot one. Also, running Romex adds to the complexity.</p>
    <p>For Phase 2, hardware we needed a Pixel Technology &#8216;PS-1 Power Inserter kit&#8217; for the broadcast radio (it includes the power inserter and the 5V <abbr>DC</abbr> transformer) and a Channel Master &#8216;Ultra Mini 2&#8217; for broadcast television (it also includes the 12V <abbr>DC</abbr> transformer), 100 feet of quad-shield copper core RG-6, two &#8216;old work&#8217; 1 gang boxes, two &#8216;two port&#8217; wall inserts and one &#8216;one port&#8217; wall inserts. Along with cover plates.</p>
    <p>It also needed molly bolts and a wall-mountable power bar.</p>
    <p>First I ran the coaxial run for the radio in the West Entry Hallway. In my mind, that was actually finishing up phase 1. After using a coaxial connection tester to verify the connection, the Bose Wave was connected to the wall jack. The Bose Wave does not tune <abbr>AM</abbr> so a band separator was not needed, and the <abbr>FM</abbr> antenna it came with was lost so even though the outdoor <abbr>FM</abbr> antenna is not yet installed, figured might as well just hook it up. For that run I used leftover quad-shield copper-clad steel RG-6.</p>
    <p>In the West Garage, the wall used for the transformers has cabinets against it, so the two 1 gang box was installed high and a power bar was mounted high on the wall near it. That allows easy access to <abbr>AC</abbr> power and the coaxial jacks even with the cabinet against the wall.</p>
    <p>Because they carry <abbr>DC</abbr> voltage, more expensive copper core was used to run coax to those jacks.</p>
    <p>For the broadcast radio Power Inserter, the coaxial run was very short. After verifying the line did carry 5V <abbr>DC</abbr> the transformer was unplugged as it is not needed yet. I did attach the coax to the power in F connector jack on the Power Inserter but I did not yet run the short piece of coaxial cable from the Power Inserter <abbr>RF</abbr> output to the splitter <abbr>RF</abbr> input, instead deciding to just loosely attach 75Ω termination caps on both the <abbr>RF</abbr> input and <abbr>RF</abbr> output of the Power Inserter.</p>
    <p>For the broadcast television two-way amplified distributor, it was a longer coaxial run. After verifying the coaxial run carried the 12V <abbr>DC</abbr>, the transformer was unplugged and I attached the coax to the power in F connector jack on the distributor. The coax run from the &#8216;West Wing&#8217; splitter was then detached from the antenna and attached to one of the outputs on the distributor, with a 75Ω termination cap on the other. A short piece of coax (copper clad steel) then fed a Channel Master <abbr>LTE</abbr> from the antenna, and short piece of coax fed the distributor input from the <abbr>LTE</abbr> filter output. The transformer brick was then plugged back in.</p>
    <p>Phase two did not any television or radio service but it provided the amplified distributor that allows for Phase 3.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="phase3" aria-labelledby="phase3.label">
    <h2 id="phase3.label">Phase 3: East Wing</h2>
    <p>Phase 3 only deals with three bedrooms in the East Wing and was the least expensive phase.</p>
    <p>For hardware, it required a four-way passive splitter, three &#8216;old work&#8217; 1 gang boxes, three one &#8216;one port&#8217; wall inserts. Along with cover plates. We did buy another 250 foot pull box of quad-shield copper-clad RG-6.</p>
    <p>The three broadcast television runs were installed on the four-way splitter and and the fourth port on the splitter had a 75Ω termination cap scewed on. using a coaxial connection tester to verify conductivity between the splitter inputs and the wall jack outputs, a 75Ω termination cap was placed on the wall in jack in the South East bedroom as it does not yet have a television, the 75Ω termination cap on the second output from the amplified distributor was removed, and coax was run from the four-way splitter to that amplified distributor output.</p>
    <p>All coaxial in Phase 3 was copper-clad steel core.</p>
    <p>After phase 3, six of the seven broadcast televison runs had been completed. Only the entertainment center still needed coaxial runs to it.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="phase4" aria-labelledby="phase4.label">
    <h2 id="phase4.label">Phase 4: Entertainment Center Rebuild</h2>
    <p>The entertainment center is on the east side of the living room, built into an alcove. About &#8531; of the horizontal space is wasted on shelving which limits the size of a television that can be installed, presently it has a 40" diagonal which is the largest it can accommodate and also restricts air flow as it is a tight fit.</p>
    <p>For the <abbr title="Too Long, Didn’t Read">TLDR</abbr> we added a coaxial run for broadcast radio and broadcast television finishing the coaxial network. You can <a href="#phase5">Skip to Phase 5</a>.</p>
    <p>This is what the entertainment center looked like <em>before</em> Phase 4 work began. Notice the visible wire mess behind the <abbr>TV</abbr>. That is one thing we wanted to avoid, just for aesthetics.</p>
    <p>First we turned off the circuit breaker for the outlets in the entertainment center and then removed the entertainment center from the alcove and the wallboard as well, giving us more freedom with behind-the wall wiring. Taut level strings were run to indicate the horizontal lines where we wanted the top of the lower wall boxes and the top of the upper wall boxes.</p>
    <p>Verifying that the circuit breaker was still turned off, a &#8216;new work&#8217; two-gang box with new outlets was installed both in the lower area and in the upper area, with necessary Romex installed. Circuit breaker was turned back on and each outlet was tested for proper wiring and then it was turned off again.</p>
    <p>A &#8216;new work&#8217; two-gang low-voltage box was installed for the existing cable coaxial jack and the existing 6P6C modular jack were installed on the left side, with the new broadcast television coaxial run to the right side. The other side of that coaxial run connected to the fourth port on the four-way splitter for the &#8216;East Wing&#8217;. A &#8216;new work&#8217; one-gang low-voltage box was installed in the upper portion for the broadcast radio coaxial run, with the under side of the run going all the way to the radio four-way splitter on the west side of the house, using the last port on that four-way splitter.</p>
    <p>A &#8216;new work&#8217; one-gang low-voltage box was installed in the lower portion for the surround sound wiring. Two additional &#8216;new work&#8217; one-gang low-voltage boxes were installed, one in lower section and one in upper section, with a conduit between them to allow running wires (hdmi <abbr>etc.</abbr>) from the top section to the lower section.</p>
    <p>Finally, a &#8216;new work&#8217; one-gang low-voltage box was installed in the upper section for a cat6e Ethernet run from the north west bedroom (where the Internet equipment is) to the entertainment center. This will allow direct Ethernet connections for devices in the entertainment center, as well as a <abbr>WiFi</abbr> router to increase wireless connectivity for the &#8216;East Wing&#8217;.</p>
    <p>With all the wiring done, the circuit breaker was temporarily turned on one last time just to verify everything was in working order. It was then turned off again, and drywall installed and painted.</p>
    <p>Supports for the two top shelves were then screwed in to the studs. Planned wires were run through the conduit before installing the shelves.</p>
    <p>Temporarily, the existing television was placed on a catering cart we have while we paid off the expenses involved in remodeling the cabinet alcove. The television cabinet we wanted was expensive and we planned to finance it over six months, so we wanted what we had financed paid off first.</p>
    <p>When we <em>did</em> purchase the television cabinet, there was about 10 inches of space between the cabinet and the back of the alcove, so supports for a non-load bearing shelf were then installed at the back just to prevent objects (including cats) from falling behind it. Finger holes were drilled into the shelf making it easy to remove when we need to deal with wires behind it.</p>
    <p>Completion of Phase 4 will actually be commenced with the purchase of a 65" <abbr>ATSC</abbr> 3.0 compatible television but we are waiting for prices to drop as <abbr>ATSC</abbr> 3.0 becomes common. The new television will likely run AndroidTV and will no longer need the Roku.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="phase5" aria-labelledby="phase5.label">
    <h2 id="phase5.label">Phase 5: Broadcast Radio Antenna</h2>
    <p>For broadcast radio, the first step was to remove the existing satellite <abbr>TV</abbr> antenna we do not use from the existing mast. An antenna mast ground clamp was installed a coaxial grounding block was installed, and ground clamps for the water main were installed. Solid copper grounding wire was then run from the antenna mast and the coaxial grounding block to the water main clamps, so that both were properly <a href="bond_earth_ground.xhtml">earthed</a>.</p>
    <p>Making sure there were no weather storms forcast during the following week, I performed the <a href="radio.xhtml#reftest">Antenna Reference Test</a> using an inexpensive but quality indoor antenna.</p>
    <p>The following day I installed the Pixel Technologies AFHD-4 <abbr>AM</abbr>/<abbr>FM</abbr> antenna onto the mast and ran coaxial cable from it directly through my window to my analog radio to perform <a href="radio.xhtml#test1">Antenna Test 1</a> that night. Note that this test was performed without the coaxial grounding block and therefore was not <abbr>NEC</abbr> compliant.</p>
    <p>The day following that test, I ran solid copper core from the four-way splitter to the grounding block. This was to bypass the power inserter for <a href="radio.xhtml#test1">Antenna Test 2</a>. A short piece of coaxial cable was installed from the antenna to the grounding block, and Antenna Test 2 was performed that night.</p>
    <p>Following day, I climbed into attic for last time (at least related to coaxial runs). I disconnected the coaxial cable at the four-way splitter input and shortened just enough (with a little play) to attach to the power inserter <abbr>RF</abbr> input, and with what was cut off, cut another short piece to go from the power inserter <abbr>RF</abbr> ouput to the four-way splitter input.</p>
    <p>Then outside, the inline surge protector was screwed directly into the amplifier <abbr>RF</abbr> input and a small length of solid copper core coaxial cable was attached to the amplifier <abbr>RF</abbr> output. This was then installed up near the coaxial grounding block with the coaxial cable screwed into the grounding block. A small run of coaxial cable then went from the antenna to the inline surge protector <abbr>RF</abbr> input.</p>
    <p>The power brick was plugged in to supply 5V <abbr>DC</abbr> to the power inserter, and the Bose Wave in the West Entry Room was used to test <abbr>FM</abbr> reception, making sure it got the <abbr>FM</abbr> stations that Antenna Test 1 indicated it should likely be able to tune.</p>
    <p>That night, <a href="radio.xhtml#test3">Antenna Test 3</a> was performed and the following two nights, <a href="radio.xhtml#test4">Antenna Test 4</a> and <a href="radio.xhtml#test5">Antenna Test 5</a> were performed.</p>
    <p>Installation is complete. All five bedrooms plus a <abbr>DVR</abbr> and the living room entertainment center have <abbr>OTA</abbr> broadcast television, and the two &#8216;West Wing&#8217; bedrooms, the &#8216;West Entry Room&#8217;, and the living room entertainment center have <abbr>OTA</abbr> broadcast radio.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="hypothetical" aria-labelledby="hypothetical.label">

    <p>If we wanted the three bedrooms in the &#8216;East Wing&#8217; to have <abbr>OTA</abbr> broadcast radio as well, a second four-way splitter and a second amplifier would be needed. The the current four-way splitter output feeding the &#8216;entertainment center&#8217; would feed the input to a second four-way splitter. It could be done, but there would a lower Signal to Noise Ratio (<abbr>SNR</abbr>) for the &#8216;East Wing&#8217; and the entertainment center as a result.</p>
    <p>One way to accomplish this with minimal impact to the &#8216;West Wing&#8217;, the power inserter would be removed so the coaxial cable runs directly from the grounding block to the existing four-way splitter. Very close to the output that services the &#8216;East Wing&#8217; a second MBA-12 amplifier would be installed with the power inserter installed shortly after that.</p>
    <p>The 5V <abbr>DC</abbr> would then power to the second amplifier and pass through the first four-way splitter to power the first amplifier.</p>
    <p>The <abbr>RF</abbr> output from the inserter would then have a coaxial run to the &#8216;East Wing&#8217; where it would feed the four-way splitter that services the three bedrooms and the entertainment center. In theory this would work&#8212;<em>possibly</em> with some lost reception of distant stations due to <abbr>RF</abbr> noise that enters prior to the second amplifier being amplified&#8212;.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, we could put the second MBA-12 amplifier directly in series with the first and leave the power inserter where it is. If <abbr>RF</abbr> amplification is then too strong for the three &#8216;West Wing&#8217; outputs, we could install -10 dB attenuators to compensate on those three splitter outputs. The fourth splitter output would then directly feed the &#8216;East Wing&#8217; splitter. That might actually be better as the <abbr>SNR</abbr> ratio could be improved in the &#8216;East Wing&#8217; outputs though it would be slightly reduced from current <abbr>SNR</abbr> in the &#8216;West Wing&#8217; outputs.</p>
    <p>We have no plans on adding radio to the &#8216;East Wing&#8217; bedrooms, but if we did, one of those two solutions is probably what we would try.</p>

    <p>Another possible upgrade would be to add SiriusXM to the broadcast coaxial network. All the parts except for the band separators already support the frequencies SiriusXM uses, so all we would need to do (in addition to adding a SiriusXM satellite antenna at the <abbr>AM</abbr>/<abbr>FM</abbr> antenna) is swap out the existing band separators for band separators that includes a SiriusXM broadcast band output. At this time, we do not have interest in doing that. SiriusXM requires a subscription fee we are not <em>currently</em> interested in paying.</p>

The radio frequency signal, abbreviated as RF, enters the coaxial system from an AFHD-4 antenna. The RF signal then enters and exits a surge surpressor before entering an MBA 12 amplifier where the RF signal is amplified by about 12 decibels. After leaving the amplifier, the RF signal enters a coaxial grounding block which is electrically bonded to the earth through a grounding rod. The RF signal leaves the grounding block where it then enters a PS-1 Power Inserter that supplies the 5 volts of direct current voltage needed by the previously mentioned MBA 12 amplifier. The RF signal leaves the PS-1 Power Inserter where it then enters a MBS-4 signal splitter to be split four ways. The first split from the MBS-4 enters an AMFMBS-1 RF signal separator, where the AM and FM bands are split into distinct RF signals which feed the AM and FM antenna inputs on a Yamaha R-S201 receiver. The second split from the MBS-4 does not have the frequency bands splits, it just enters the FM antenna port on a Bose Wave. The third split from the MBS-4 is currently terminated by a 75Ω termination cap to be used for a radio in the future. The fourth split from the MBS-4 enters a second AMFMBS-1 signal separator where the AM and FM bands are separated to feed the AM and FM antenna inputs on a Sangean HDT-20 tuner.

  <p>All coaxial cable from the Antenna to the MBS-4 is quad shield solid core copper. The runs from the MBS-4 to the coaxial jacks in the wall use quad shield copper clad steel as they do not carry any <abbr>DC</abbr> voltage.</p>
  <p>Allegedly the MBS-4 has a 12 dB signal loss per output opposed to the 7&#8211;8 dB typical of 4-way splitters designed for the smaller television band. In essence, that means MBA-12 compensates for the splitter but does not compensate for cable length.</p>
  <p>I do not know what the dB signal loss is for the AMFMBS-1 band splitter.</p>
