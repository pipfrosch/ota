  <p>For 75Î© impedence antenna systems, there are basically five different types of coaxial cable to consider. There are also several tools and accessories that you will need when working with coaxial cable runs.</p>

    <h2 id="rg59">RG-59</h2>
    <p>Historically, RG-59 was often used by professional installers because it was much cheaper than RG-6.</p>
    <p>At 400 MHz, RG-59 loses about 7.0 dB of signal per 100 feet while RG-6 only loses about 4.3 dB. Now that RG-6 is much more affordable and widely available, RG-59 should generally be avoided for television and radio signals.</p>
    <p>At very short distances where flexibility is needed&#8212;such as between your wall jack and your television&#8212;the signal loss difference will be very small which may make choosing RG-59 for that small distance an accessible trade-off for the increased flexibility.</p>
    <p>RG-59 should not be used between the antenna and your wall jacks and really should only be used between a wall jack and a tuner when you just happen to have excess lying around.</p>

    <h2 id="rg6ds.label">Dual-Shield RG-6</h2>
    <p>While not as flexible as RG-59, Dual-Shield RG-6 is much more flexible than Quad-Shield RG-6.</p>
    <p>It often works just fine inside a wall but with longer runs Dual-Shield RG-6 is more susceptible to interference than Quad-Shield RG-6 which can degrade the Signal to Noise Ratio (<abbr>SNR</abbr>) potentially causing some reception issues.</p>
    <p>Due to the increased flexibility, I recommend Dual-Shield RG-6 for the initial antenna location testing and for the short runs from the wall plate to the <abbr>ATSC</abbr> or radio receiver.</p>
    <p>White is often a more aesthetic color coating for the run from the wall plate to the receiver and 100 feet is a good length for testing the antenna location.</p>

    <h2 id="rg6qs.clad.label">Quad-Shield RG-6 Copper-Clad</h2>
    <p>Quad-Shield RG-6 is far less susceptible to <abbr>RF</abbr> interference than Dual-Shield RG-6, though it is a little less flexible.</p>
    <p>For carrying a <abbr>RF</abbr> signal, there is no difference between a copper-clad steel core and a solid copper core, so Quad-Shield RG-6 Copper-Clad is what I recommend for most if not all of the coaxial cable runs between your antenna and the wall plates.</p>
    <p>Even if you need more than 250 feet for the sum of all your runs, I recommend buying 250 feet pull boxes. They are much easier to work with than reels and the weight of 250 feet is still light enough to make it easy to climb up into your attic with it. Make sure a quality brand is used, and make sure the coaxial cable has marking so it is easy to see how much you used for a particular run. In the event you are running it in plenum space or in an <abbr>HVAC</abbr> duct, make sure it is plenum rated.</p>
    <p>The Quad-Shield RG-6 Copper-Clad that I used is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mediabridge-Broadband-Coaxial-Cable-Black/dp/B0193RRT2W" title="Internet Resource">Mediabridge Black (250 feet) Pull-Out Box</a>. It is more expensive than the same length of other brands at the chain hardware stores but I wanted to reduce the odds of cable failure over time.</p>

  <section id="rg6qs.core" aria-labelledby="rg6qs.core.label">
    <h2 id="rg6qs.core.label">Quad-Shield RG-6 Copper-Core</h2>
    <p>A solid copper core versus copper-clad steel core makes absolutely no difference for <abbr>RF</abbr> transmission over the coaxial cable.</p>
    <p>For the direct current used to power amplification, solid copper core does have less resistance than copper-clad steel and therefore is <em>preferable</em> though it is not critical, amplifiers will still do their job even with copper-clad steel. Allegedly some sattelite dish controllers are touchy and require copper core if the run is over a certain length, check with your sattelite vendor if using RG-6 to carry a voltage to a sattelite dish controller.</p>
    <p>The disadvantage to using copper-core is that it is more expensive than copper-clad steel.</p>
    <p>For coaxial runs that carry <abbr>DC</abbr> voltage, I do recommend using Quad-Shield RG-6 Copper-Core but only if you can find it in lengths that are not excessive to your needs. Phat Satellite <abbr>Intl</abbr> sells it in various lengths on Amazon, e.g. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PHAT-SATELLITE-INTL-Satellite-Broadband/dp/B01GC0T61A" title="Internet Resource">100 feet Quad Shield Solid Copper 3GHZ RG-6 Coaxial Cable</a> is what I used for my <abbr>DC</abbr> voltage needs.</p>

    <h2 id="rg11.label">RG-11</h2>
    <p>For long runs, RG-11 does have less signal loss than RG-6 but it is expensive, very thick, and extremely difficult to work with for any runs that are not straight.</p>
    <p>For runs under 100 feet, the reflective properties of RG-11 may actually make it worse than RG-6.</p>
    <p>For runs from 100 feet to 200 feet, the benefit is not worth the difficulty of working with RG-11, it <em>usually</em> better to overcome signal loss through signal amplification unless there really is not way to power an amplifier at the start of the run.</p>
    <p>For runs that are over 200 feet in length and relatively straight, then RG-11 could be considered.</p>
    <p>Unless you happen to live in a mansion, or if the best place for your antenna is on an out-building, RG-11 is almost certainly the wrong choice.</p>
